    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented individual with a strong interest in technology and computers. Originally
        from Syria, I studied dental technology before moving to the Netherlands, where I transitioned to a career in
        tech. After completing the NT2-B2 Dutch language exams, I enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science
        with a specialization in programming at Hogeschool Utrecht. Alongside my job as a phone repair technician and
        salesperson, I also took on the role of webshop and marketplace manager at my current company. In this position,
        I developed skills in WordPress, WooCommerce, and Google Ads, which further deepened my passion for technology.
        I am now focused on advancing my programming expertise with the goal of starting a freelance business or
        building a career in the tech industry.
